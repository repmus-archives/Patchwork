ÊÊ ¥ Copy the MidiShare 'init' in to the System Folder of your startup disk.¥ Restart your computer, the MidiShare icon should appear at startup.Note for Mac IIfx users:  Due to the differences in the serial ports on the Mac IIfx, you will need to install a IIfx Serial Switch.  To do this, copy the IIfx Serial Switch 'CDEV' into your System Folder, restart the computer and choose the 'compatible' option from the IIfx Control Panel. Please contact the nearest Apple dealer to receive a copy of this IIfx Serial Switch 'init'.ÊUse the MidiShare Control Panel (located in the system folder) to set the MidiShare preferences (see figure 1).ÊÊMidiShare has its own real-time memory manager in which all MidiShare data (including all MIDI data) is represented as events. MidiShare allocates the memory to store these events when the first client application is opened. This memory space is freed when the last client application is closed.  Adjust the  MidiShare memory size according to the number of events you plan to store.Ê¥ Use Time ManagerSet this option ON if you experience compatibility problems. Otherwise, setting this option OFF will increase your computers performance by bypassing the Time Manager.¥ Use MidiTimePieceªMidiShare supports the MidiTimePieceª from Mark of the Unicorn, Inc.When ON, MidiShare drives directly the corresponding ports (from 8 to 32) for up to 512 separated MIDI channels.When this option is ON, set Fast Rate x1 on the MidiTimePiece, otherwise set it to 1Mhz Async.Note: don't use the MTP desk accessory to configure the interface, as it is not MidiShare compatible. The MidiShare software should access to MTP internally.ÊSet this option OFF only if your system uses Finder.ÊThe Shift key or a Mouse click during the launch procedure should de-activate MidiShare installation. MidiShare is inactive when a cross appears on its icon.For any additionnal information, please, direct your requests or comments to the following address:ÊWeb servers:GRAME : http://www.grame.frMidiShare : http://www.grame.fr/english/MidiShare.html
