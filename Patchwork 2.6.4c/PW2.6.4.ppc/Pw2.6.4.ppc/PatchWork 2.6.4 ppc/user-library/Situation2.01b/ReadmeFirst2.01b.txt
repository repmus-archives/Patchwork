;; This is version 2.01b (February 1998) of the musical constraint satisfaction solver ;; SITUATION ( © IRCAM ) developped by Antoine Bonnet & Camilo Rueda. It runs in PW and;; in Open Music.;; Some modifications, notably in the solver,  were done by ;;      Frank Valencia (Grupo AVISPA, Universidad Javeriana de Cali).;;;     December, 1996 ;;; Please report bugs or problems to;;;     crueda@ircam.fr  or to   crueda@atlas.ujavcali.edu.co;;;     2.01b  is a transition version leading to 2.1, scheduled for November 1998. The main change in 2.01b  is the generalization of the notion of Ambitus. This isdone in two ways:1. The Ambitus  entry to box Csolver  is no longer specified as a range (given as a couple of lowest and highest values). It is now specified as the full set of possible values. This allows the Ambitus  to contain "holes" or regions where objects (e.g. notes) areforbidden. For example, in version 2.0 an ambitus specification for a problem with8 chords containing notes in the set going from 48 up to 72 could be the following:(0_7 (48 72))In version 2.01b  this is written: (0_7 (48_72)) .Specifying the same ambitus, but excluding notes from A to C in the middle range is written (0_7 (48_56 61_72)). All patches in the tutorial have been changed to reflect the new syntax.2. An approximation value can be given. It is used in all constraints to relax the meaning of equality. Objects (notes, intervals and the like) are considered equal up tothe approximation value given. For example, the Ambitus specification(app  0.5 0_7 (48_72s0.2))fixes an approximation value of 0.5. The set of possible note values is then given forall 8 chords (i.e. chords 0 up to 7) as the set {48, 48.2, 48.4,..., 72}. Now, if a constraintimposes, say, horizontal intervals in the set (3.5 7)  (i.e. a minor third plus quarter tone,and a fifth), then the melody (58.6  54.9  62) satisfies the constraint since its horizontal intervals (3.7 7.2) are in the supplied set, up to an approximation of 0.5 (a quarter tone).If no approximation is given in the Ambitus specification, Situation 2.01b  behaves as inversion 2.0.  See the patch "approx.pw" (in PW) or  "approximation" (in OM) in folder "Sit examples").In addition to this, Version 2.1, scheduled for November 1998, generalizes the notionof a musical object so as to deal with rhythms in a more appropriate way. Musical objects are seen as collections of points and distances in a suitable space. Theuser can define his/her own notion of distance and point. All constraints are thentranslated by the system to accomodate the type of musical space so defined.
